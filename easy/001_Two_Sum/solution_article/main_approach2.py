"""
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the
two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not
use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Approach 2: Two-pass Hash Table

Intuition

To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if 
the complement exists in the array. If the complement exists, we need to get 
its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in 
the array to its index? A hash table.

We can reduce the lookup time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed. 
A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup 
in near constant time. I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a lookup
could degenerate to O(n) time. However, lookup in a hash table should be
amortized O(1) time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.

Algorithm

A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add 
each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table.
Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement 
(targetâˆ’nums[i]) exists in the hash table. If it does exist, we return current
element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must
not be nums[i] itself!
